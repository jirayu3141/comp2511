 Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects
by placing these objects inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors, whereas, 
builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step. 
Decorator lets you add funcitonlity later whereas builder lets you add fucntionality
at creation time.
