Factory pattern deal with the problem of creating objects without having to specify 
the exact class of the object that will be created, whereas, abstract Factory specializes in 
creating families of related objects. Many designs start by using Factory Method (less complicated
and more customizable via subclasses) and evolve toward Abstract Factory. 
Factory method doesn't require the use of abstract class whereas it is required in
abstract factory method.
